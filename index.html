              In 1947, the college made a modest beginning as New Engineering
              College, with a single program leading to B.E. (Civil) degree. In
              the year 1955, the College was renamed as Walchand College of
              Engineering as part of the new arrangements and pursuant to the
              Rehabilitation and Development Program mainly funded by Seth
              Walchand Hirachand Memorial Trust and the Government. The
              Government appointed an Ad Hoc Committee for conducting the
              college from May 1955, later replaced by the Administrative
              Council in 1956. The Ad Hoc Committee added two more degree
              programs in B.E. (Mechanical) and B.E. (Electrical) in 1955 with
              the intake of 20 each. Three Diploma programs also started in
              1955: Civil (40 intake), Mechanical (20) and Electrical (20).
